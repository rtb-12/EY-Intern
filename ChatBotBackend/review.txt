Switching from Windows to my first MacBook, the Air M3, has been a seamless experience. It's lightweight yet powerful, with the M3 chip handling everything effortlessly, including video editing. The Retina display is stunning, and the battery life easily lasts a full day. Easy to navigate and super efficient. Itâ€™s a perfect blend of power and portability. ||| Great quality & very efficiently working. ||| This is a great laptop for anyone who wants to do their everyday work without any issues, it just works. it's very lightweight so you can carry it anywhere. MacBook is also great pair for those who already own an iPhone. I have bought 16gb ram and 512gb storage option to make it future proof, display is great, getting battery backup more than 12 hours. ||| It is a value for money product. Powerful machine capable of doing some High end editing and also compatible of doing 3d rendering. The delivery was also quick and good. ||| Original product in sturdy packaging for tough transportation conditions. ||| :) ||| Being a software developer, my day to day tasks involve coding, debugging, deployment, db management etc. I mostly use Docker to build any of my server side backend applications locally and Macbook Air handles it smoothly! Just a recommendation, go for at least 16 GB of RAM as Docker itself takes 4GB of RAM. The extra RAM will help you for sure! ||| Good ||| Product is good.From apple web site we get the same m3 for a lower price. ||| good one ||| Class apart ||| good ||| Go for it. Much better then Intel laptop in terms of performance, sound, camera.. ||| The MacBook Air m3 is the best device by performance wise, evrything works very fast better battery life and easy to use. As the device is very slim, we can carry it everywhere. Sound quality could be better alike MacBook pro, anyways it's still better than the other products in range. ||| Doesn't have a cooling vent so you can keep it anywere, without worring about dust getting in, however it an hassle if you don't have a microsoft home subscription. ||| Used for my work ||| Absolutely stunned with its looks.So far ðŸ’» looks good.Will keep posted upon couple of months of usage !!Go for it.Too pricy but again such is the product. ||| Over-all this is good to have but it's battery is not as mentioned in description.I am using vscode for development code a, slack/meet during day time and battery lasts only arround 4 hours.Other this it's awesome product ||| Nice QualityBetter Battery BackupNice Retina DisplayJust Looking Wowww ||| No negetive comments excellent ||| As I have been using from past 3weeks only observation from me is the battery backup is not up to the standard and when the video streaming is on I could see only 4-5hrs of the battery am not sure is this with the recent OS update or wat? ||| Too good |||  ||| Super sleek machine with ultimate power house hardware. Bought 512GB model with 16GB RAM. ||| It's good and reliable and easy to use. It was meant to be for the IT professionals and we made use of all the features ||| The delivery took almost four weeks, despite continuous follow-ups and even a dispute with the country leads on Twitter. It was finally delivered, and while the wait was long, the product itself is excellent. This is my first Mac, as I've always used Windows before, and I must say it's greatâ€”plus, I got it at a deal price! :) ||| The media could not be loaded. Bought the laptop 5 days ago , hasn't even been a week. Hangs up multiple times. |||  ||| The media could not be loaded. Please do not buy it. ||| Unable to install Xcode and some other software ||| The battery lasts for 8-10 hrs easily, the screen is just too good and handles everyday tasks very, very easily. The sound quality is top notch as well. The Os, which is the selling point of macbooks, has delivered once again. Recommended for college students and IT professionals. Go for starlight colour instead of midnight. ||| 8gb ram is too much, they can give 64mb ram and gives us good old days back. and 512mb hdd is enough. ||| Quality is fantastic. And performance is mind-blowing.easy to use. Display is also good. Easy to handle in bags due to its thiness ||| I liked everything about it because it's so fast and it's very useful for my video editing and for University ||| the product is delivered faulty and returned to the vendor , the vendor kept the item as out of stock and havent delivered the new product only, Almost after a week to 10 days with multiple complaints and escalations they finally refunded my money ||| It's not letting to login even though the right passward is entered.Defective OS.It's been couple of hours i bought it all of sudden it logged out and now it's not logging in ||| This Mac has the best Processor for moderate use. Display is awesome. So smooth to use, with best security. You can simply go with it.My story with MAC : .........Mac OS is the best, for those who are willing to work on it.
